# Trading-Strategy-II-Fscore
F score trading strategy is based on the premise of taking into account of the several accounting parameters like ROA, accruals, CFO etc. In total there are  points to score  

## The 9 metrics are as follows
  Profitability
  
    1-ROA(Return on Asset)
    
    2-CFO(Cash Flow from Operations)
    
    3-Delta ROA
    
    4-Accruals
    
  Capital Structure
    
    1-Delta Leverage
    
    2-Delta Current Ratio
    
    3-EQ Offer(any split or public offering)
    
  Operational Efficiency
    
    1-Delta Margin
    
    2-Delta Turnover
## Strategy
  Total Fscore is the sum of scores obtained in each of these metrics out of 9 So, I went long on stocks with F-score > 7 and shorted those firms with F-score < 3
  
## Result
If we invested ₹100/- in the Fscore hedge during 2013-14, we would get a cummulative return of 92.3% in year 2019 with ₹192.3/-. The annual return would be 18.46%
